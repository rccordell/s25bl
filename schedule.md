## A Note on the Schedule

Each week there are readings listed under _Core_ and _Penumbra_. The core readings are just that: central to the week's discussion and lab. Everyone should read these closely and prepare to discuss them as described in the "Class Preparation" assignment. 

The penumbral readings try to capture a broader set of brilliant readings pertinent to each week's theme that I could not require because time is, sadly, finite. Each week you should choose (at least) one of the penumbral readings, based on your own interests, to read and be prepared to reference as a means of expanding our conversation together. The penumbral readings are organized by publication date, not priority, so you should not feel compelled to choose the first one each week. Find one to read that genuinely sparks your interest!

<center><hr></center>

# Chapter 2: Platform

To prepare for our labs in the coming weeks, you should choose one of the definitions of "the book" Amaranth Borsuk compiled from scholars, artists, writers, and many others when writing _The Book_. Find a definition that resonates with your own understandings of and ambitions for the book: one that feels somehow meaningful to you. The <https://t-h-e-b-o-o-k.com/> website does not work well anymore, but is [archived through the Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20210301122906/https://t-h-e-b-o-o-k.com/definitions/), where the collected definitions are easier to browse.
