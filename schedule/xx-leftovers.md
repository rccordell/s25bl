To prepare for our labs in the coming weeks, you should choose one of the definitions of "the book" Amaranth Borsuk compiled from scholars, artists, writers, and many others when writing _The Book_. Find a definition that resonates with your own understandings of and ambitions for the book: one that feels somehow meaningful to you. The <https://t-h-e-b-o-o-k.com/> website does not work well anymore, but is [archived through the Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20210301122906/https://t-h-e-b-o-o-k.com/definitions/), where the collected definitions are easier to browse.
