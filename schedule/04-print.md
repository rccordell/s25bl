### Core

+ Lisa Gitelman, "Print Culture (Other Than Codex): Job Printing and Its Importance" from _Comparative Textual Media_ (2013), [resource via library](http://proxy2.library.illinois.edu/login?url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctt5hjjtq.3)
+ Amaranth Borsuk, ["The Book as Content"](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/uiuc/reader.action?docID=5376610&ppg=79) from _The Book_ (2018), [resource via library](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/uiuc/detail.action?docID=5376610)
+ Choose your favorite definition of "The Book" from Amaranth Borsuk [published definitions](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy2.library.illinois.edu/pub/124/article/763103), which she compiled while writing _The Book_ and published along with [an introduction to the project](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy2.library.illinois.edu/pub/124/article/763102), in the [_American Book Review_](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy2.library.illinois.edu/issue/42793). You can read them in those articles (I recommend the PDFs for the best designed experience).
+ Watch videos 2-9 in this [orientation playlist from my previous press](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_sY2bPJ-fqe6NL06P_V1WH0ksPQePd2a) (watch from "Investigating a Composed Form of Type" to "Woodcuts"). These will explain the basics of typesetting with a close-up video of the process and allow us to jump into our lab more quickly. This should take 30-40 minutes in total, but please pay close attention—the details are important.
