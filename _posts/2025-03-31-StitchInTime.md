Today we will be learning two basic book binding stitches: a 5-hole pamphlet stitch, which we will use for our class chapbook, and a stab binding, which we will use for our class zine. I will be demonstrating both, but I provide these resources so you can go back, pause, rewind, and return to them after class.

We will only have time to cover two stitches in a single lab, but there are a plethora of additional resources in the world you might use for other patterns and styles, if relevant to your book project. YouTube is absolutely chock full of binding tutorials, and I have a few books at Skeuomorph describing hundreds of binding styles that you can use as a reference.

### Japanese Stab Binding

+ ["How to Create a Book Using the Japanese Stab Binding Method"](https://blog.papercraftpanda.com/how-to-make-book-japanese-stab-binding-history-patterns-technique/)
+ (Video) ["Make Time: Japanese Book-Binding"](https://youtu.be/ObFKbFXjJXA?si=S-Av6Bi2AXNB0UE8)

+ (Video) ["Binding A Japanese Stab Bound Book Â· Timelapse."](https://youtu.be/s9P07WAbYHs?si=z2UDQuN1p4ItiHVM) Less a tutorial and more a demonstration, but this shows a slightly more advanced version of what we will do in class, as she constructs a separate cover and spine structure that's then attached to the body of her book.
+ ["A Theory of Japanese Stab Binding"](https://beccamakingfaces.com/theory-of-japanese-stab-binding/) is not really a tutorial, but features some of the more elaborate binding structures such as the "butterfly" or "dancing snowflakes" binds
